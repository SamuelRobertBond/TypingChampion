Typing Champ is a typing fighting game made for the 2017 A Game by its cover game jam. The game jam required us to make a game inspired by artwork given in the are exhibition linked below. We used the Libgdx Game Development Framework and Kryonet.

How To Play:

After connecting to a lobby click ready in order to queue yourself for a match. 

Type the words given in order to gain energy. Energy can be used to preform move. Currently the moves you can preform are Jab, Hook, Cross, Uppercut, Counter, and Block.
Certain moves chain into other moves and can be used to counter moves preformed by opponents. The game requires a high typing speed and great reactions.
